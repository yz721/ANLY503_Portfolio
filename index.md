Hi! This is **Yunxi Zhang**. Welcome to my ANLY 503 Portfolio!

Let me show you around! Click on the link to see my assignments and final project!


## Assignment 5
### Static Visualization Assignment
### Introduction & Data
In the previous assignment, you started working with the raw data dumps from the bank's systems, you tidied (is that even a verb?!?) some datasets, and you created an analytical dataset. An analytical dataset may be tidy or not -there is somewhat of a gray area there- however, it is a dataset that can be used for both data visualization and modeling.

We are providing an extended analytical dataset, with one record per account and many different variables/measurements/features for each account.

We are also providing the transactions.csv data as well so you can build some visualizations from the raw data.

### Instructions & Tasks
Use the data provided in the files above to create analysis and visualizations that answer the posed question or complete the task.

Explore all accounts. Create visualizations that combine or these account characteristics:

 1.Whether an account has a credit card or not.
 
 2.Whether an account has a loan or not.
 
 3.The average balance for the account.
 
 4.What is the distribution of all loans and what are their characteristics?
 
 5.Is there a relationship between a good or bad loan and the time between an account is opened an the loan is created? Is there a specific set of accounts that seem to be at higher or lower risk of defaulting?
 
 6.For the account with the highest number of transactions, make a time series line plot for the behavior of the account over time, including all debits and credits, the different methods, and the with the different categories.
 
 7.Explore the validity of the data for the case whether or not an account has a credit card and whether or not they have associated credit card transactions. Is there anything worth noting?

## Final Project
This is Final project is the visulizations of NYC Restaurant Reviews in 2018.
Check to see which restaurant attracts you the most.
